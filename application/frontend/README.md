# Liveworks Frontend

Created using NextJS, language of choice is Typescript.

To brush up on what nextjs is, use this link and follow their tutorial [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

### Tools
Will be using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

`grapqhql-codegen` is used for talking to the api

### Graphql queries/mutations

In order to talk with the backend api, which is built on graphql, you need to create queries and mutations in `/app/src/graphql/mutations || queries`.

These mutations or queries must subscribe to the schema generated by the api or else you'll get errors when you run `npm run codegen`, as it will cause issues with code generation.

I have made a singleton class inside `/app/src/graphql/client.ts` that you can use to interact with the api in your code.



### Development

1. `npm i` to install npm packages
2. `npm run codegen` to watch for code changes and automatically validate your queries/mutations
3. `npm run build` to build the project (this will check all your types, same as running `tsc`)
4. `npm run dev` to start the server locally outside of docker (you will usually not need to do this, unless you are debugging it or run into issues with docker)
