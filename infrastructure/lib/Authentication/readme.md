# AWS Cognito Stack

Responsible for authorization, signUp, authentication, forgot password etc.

This stack is responsible for creating the cognito user pool.

You can also use this stack to create identity pools, setup user related iam roles and more.

For now we don't need any of these so we will stick with just a cognito user pool.
